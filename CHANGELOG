PasswordMaker Java Edition Change Log

X.X.X
  - Issue 29 fixed. Hash marks, '#', no longer cause problems in the input URL.
  - Issue 30 fixed. If a file with name that ends with ".rdf" exists in the
    directory where pwmje was launched, pwmje will attempt to launch it. If
    the file is invalid, pwmje will silently fail (since it is entirely
    possible to have other rdf files in the same directory).  Additionally
    if no file is found, it will attempt to load the following files:
      o $HOME/passwordmaker.rdf
      o $HOME/pwmje.rdf
      o $HOME/.pwmje.rdf
      o $HOME/.passwordmakerrc
    Again, any failure will be silent.
      
0.6.0
  - "Default" account behavior added.  This allows for dynamic URLs to be used
    unlike the static URLs used in other accounts. This matches the behavior
    of the web verison of passwordmaker.
  - When filtering accounts, the account tree now expands to show the accounts
    as well as selects the 1st possible account.
  - Added hotkeys (use "command" in OSX):
      Ctrl+F = Jump to filter textbox (still makes a system beep, not
               really sure why).
      Ctrl+N = New
      Ctrl+O = Open
      Ctrl+S = Save
      Pressing enter in the filter textbox jumps to the master pasword textbox.
  - Fixed bug where the password was generated incorrectly while adding a
    new account.
  - The source code has been partitioned into an engine set of packages and
    an application set of packages. This allows the engine to be used in other
    applications.
  - Fixed bugs where "Open" and "New" didn't prompt for saving of the current
    file. 
  - Added a few more unit tests.
  - Added an exception dialog if an uncaught exception gets thrown from the 
    main window.
